# WordFinder App

This is an application that was built using Ruby on Rails and JavaScript. This app allows users to start a new game, enter words to gain points, and store their total points. Users can also view all other users and their total points.

Instructions are below and can be viewed at any time by clicking the Instructions button. Users must create a user account before starting a game. 

1. Click Start New Game to start a new game.
2. A word will appear on the page and you enter words, one at a time, that can be formed from that word. 
3. You will get points for each valid word that you enter. A word is valid if it is at least 4 letters, is only formed from letters found in the published word, and each letter in the published word is used only once.
4. Guess as many words as you can, then start a new game to get more points.

Scoring:
4 letter words = 1 point each
5 letter words = 2 points each
6 letter words = 3 points each

Good luck!
